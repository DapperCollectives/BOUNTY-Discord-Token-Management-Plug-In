# Dapper Collectives Bounty Participation Agreement

We’re pleased to invite you to participate in Dapper Labs’ bounty program (the “Program”) under the terms and conditions in this Bounty Participation Agreement (this “Agreement”). By participating and/or submitting a proposal content in this Program, you agree to the following terms and conditions. If your bounty is selected 

# Program Design

The Program has two parts:
- Request For Proposals
- Bounty Submission Agreement.

# Request for Proposal

All bounty opportunities will be listed in GitHub. Each bounty will be classified as either Gold, Silver, or Bronze based on priority and reward amount. You will find all of the information associated with each individual bounty in the listings on the notion page. 

New bounties will be shared via GitHub and Twitter as soon as they become available. We recommend following both accounts and turning on alert notifications to stay current on all opportunities.

After finding a bounty opportunity that you wish to pursue, you may seek to claim the bounty by opening an issue in the relevant repo. This proposal should include a PRD write up/tech spec document that includes all team members, necessary team member information (including the contact information of who we should contact if your PRD should be selected), and why your team is best suited for delivering this bounty. Please ensure that your proposal addresses all milestones outlined in the bounty description. 

All PRDs and all other content or materials submitted by you as part of this Program (“Submitted Content”) must be made public and licensed under an OSI-approved license to be considered. You hereby grant and agree to grant the rights to all Submitted Content under terms of the OSI-approved license specified in your PRD. If no license is specified, you hereby grant and agree to grant all such rights under the Apache 2.0 license. The decision of which PRD to select is based on the judgment of the Dapper Collectives engineering team, in their sole discretion.

The first team that submits a claim proposal via GitHub that is approved by the Dapper Collectives engineering team will have the opportunity to progress to the Bounty Submission Agreement stage. At this point, the bounty will be marked as claimed on all platforms. Once the bounty is claimed, we will contact the team whose PRD is approved to enter into a Bounty Submission Agreement. 

To clarify, until such time that you enter into a fully-executed Bounty Submission Agreement with Dapper Collectives, Dapper Labs is under no obligation to compensate you for the public submissions you make during the Request for Proposal period.

# Bounty Submission Agreement

After contacting you, we will assess your eligibility to participate in the Program, based on compliance with applicable law and the ability to successfully pay you through an appropriate payment provider. 

To be eligible to participate in the Program, you must meet a number of requirements including being at least 18 years old or have reached the age of majority in your jurisdiction of primary residence and citizenship, and other requirements as detailed in the Bounty Submission Agreement.

If you meet these eligibility requirements and enter into Bounty Submission Agreement with us, you’ll start working on the Bounty in stages or milestones as outlined in the bounty description.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dapper may seek equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
