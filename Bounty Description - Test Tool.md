# Overview

The Discord Token Management Plugin is a tool for community managers and DAO founders who want to build on the Flow network. This plug-in would allow community managers to establish token-gated Discords, map Flow wallet addresses to Discord User IDs, and keep track of user activities in order to retroactively distribute rewards to active community members.

The plug-in should be simple and straightforward to set up and use throughout the lifespan of a Discord community, from its earliest beginnings to scaling up to thousands of users. 

The admin of a community should be able to use the plug-in to accomplish the following:
  - Install the plug-in to their Discord server and set up basic parameters for access 
  - Manage and update the token-gating mechanism to change requirements over time
  - Set up a rewards system by choosing which in-Discord activities to track and what weight to give them
  - Run a command to generate a ranking of community members based on that algorithm
  - Export a CSV file of the community rankings

Key Features for Initial Release
  - Ability to token-gate access to a Discord server using Fungible or Non-Fungible Tokens on Flow
  - Ability to connect/correlate Flow wallet addresses to Discord User IDs
  - Ability to rank users based on their activities within Discord
  - Ability to calculate rewards owed to users based on their respective rank
  - Intuitive landing page with thorough documentation on how to use the plug-in

# Project Bounty
 - $20,000 USD to be paid out in equivalent value of $FLOW tokens in 25% installments across each milestone

# Bounty Overview

Weâ€™re looking for small teams of experienced engineers and product designers who are excited to build out tools for the Flow ecosystem. Our bounty program favors builders that are interested in working collaboratively with Dapper Collectives to make Web3 more open and accessible to all. Every bounty is broken up into several milestones that allow teams to collect feedback, show progress, and collect milestone payments.

For the Discord Token Management Plugin project, the milestones are:

1. Product Requirements Documentation and Tech Spec Review
   - Provide a thorough PRD for how the plug-in will work and associated technical documentation for how the product will be built. This should include a maintenance plan for the code once deployed.
   - Review the documentation with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure the viability of the implementation
   - Due within 10-14 days from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone
2. Front-End Prototype Review
   - Provide a clickable prototype of the plug-in front-end that clearly illustrates the anticipated user flows for a production build
   - Review the front-end prototype with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect UI/UX feedback
   - Due within 6-10 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone
3. Back-End Codebase Review
   - Walk through the technical implementation of the back-end of the plug-in
   - Review with members of the Dapper Collectives team to collect feedback and ensure viability of the implementation
   - Due within 6-10 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone
4. Production-Grade Build Complete
   - Provide full codebase for the plug-in for review by the Dapper Collectives team
   - Due within 4 weeks from assignment of project; teams that do not meet their deadlines will be at risk of having their bounty reassigned
   - 25% of the total bounty reward will be paid upon completion of this milestone
   - Upon reaching Milestone 4, the codebase for the plug-in must be turned over to Dapper Collectives for final deployment
